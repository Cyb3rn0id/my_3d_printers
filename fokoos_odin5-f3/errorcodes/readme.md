**Error Codes**

*ERR1*  
The hot bed exceeds the maximum temperature limit. Check if thermal interface is shorted.  
  
*ERR2*  
The nozzle exceeds the  maximum temperature limit. Check if thermal interface is shorted.  
  
*ERR3*  
The hot bed exceeds the minimum temperature limit. Check if thermal inteface is disconnected.  

*ERR4*  
The nozzle exceeds the minimum temperature limit. Check if thermal interface is disconnected.  

*ERR5*  
The heating of nozzle fails to reach the set temperature within allowed time. Chek thermal interface, PID.

*ERR6*  
The heating of hot bed fails to reach the set temperature within allowed time. Chek thermal interface, PID. (stock firmware of Odin-5 doesn't allow to set PID for heated bed)

*ERR7*  
Thermal runaway.
